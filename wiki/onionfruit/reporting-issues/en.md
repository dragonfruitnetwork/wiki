# Reporting Issues

Want to report an issue? That's great, we greatly appreciate your help to make the program better. By following the steps below you can speed up the process and all parties involved will be happy.

### 1. Give us as much detail to go on as possible
By telling us "x doesn't work" assumes we are mind readers (we're not). Tell us in as much detail as you can what you did, what went wrong and what was expected. If your issue was to do with bridges, send us the bridge config. If your issue was to do with DNS, send us the DNS settings you've got. You'd be surprised how easy it is to fix an issue if we reproduce it... 

### 2. Include the logs
Logs can be found at `%localappdata%\DragonFruit Network\OnionFruit\Logs` and a new log file is created each time the app is started. These log files only include most of the entries we need. In some cases (when the issue is to do with the tor client), we'll need some more log files which can be procured by running `%localappdata%\OnionFruitConnect\DragonFruit.OnionFruit.Windows.exe -v` (Win+R, paste, run). Once the issue has happened, you can close the app and the more detailed logs can be found in the same directory as the previous ones, but in a newer file. You can see if the command has worked because these logs will have lines with `[vrb]` and `[dbg]` in them.

### 3. Don't expect a 30-second fix
We're not a massive team that can fix everything instantly. Some issues are non-actionable by us, and will require us to wait for resolution. Please be patient.

### 4. Telling us what we should do won't go down well
Entitled tones are not welcome here or on our Discord group. If you have a question, ask it in a sensible fashion. Those who can't follow this rule will be restricted from interacting with us

### 5. Create an issue!
Create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/dragonfruitnetwork/onionfruit/issues) with a title and description. Attach the logs and submit. We'll get round to it as fast as humanly possible. If you've got a quick question, feel free to join our [Discord](https://dragonfruit.network/a/discord) and get verified before posting
