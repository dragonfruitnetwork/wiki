# Getting Started

## Minimum Requirements

- 2GB RAM
- **Non** proxied internet connection (ie a work or school may not work here)
- Windows 10. You **must** have .NET Framework **4.7.2** or **4.8** installed. 
> Please note we won't respond to support requests for clients running Windows 8.1 or below

## Download and Install

1. If you don't already have .NET Framework, go to the Microsoft Website and download the latest version (any edition will do, but the SDK is bigger and not needed). You should reboot after this, to stop any future issues after installation. You may not need to do this if you have Windows 10 and have updated it in the last year.
2. Grab the latest copy of OnionFruit™ [here](https://github.com/dragonfruitnetwork/onionfruit/releases/latest/download/install.exe).
3. Run and install the downloaded file.
4. Wait for the app to start. It can take up to 15 seconds depending on what else your computer is doing. If nothing has happened, check the desktop. There should be a shortcut to launch the app

## Connecting to Tor

OnionFruit™ Makes it easy to get connected in seconds:

1. Select an exit country, if you do not have a preference, leave it set to Random and proceed. This cannot be changed whilst connected (you must disconnect to change countries)
2. Flick the toggle in the coloured header on the right hand side. Wait a few seconds for it to go green and then you are free to browse on whatever you want.
3. To disconnect, flick the switch back and wait for it to go red.
