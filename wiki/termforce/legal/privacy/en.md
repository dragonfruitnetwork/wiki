# TermForce Privacy

TermForce is a custom built blogging platform operated by DragonFruit Network for [A Special Builder's Notes](https://aspecialbuildersnotes.com). This software contains elements that users can submit content, in the form of comments, to a specific post and subscribe to replies or new posts. The headings below outline the data collected and third party services involved.

### Analytics

TermForce uses Google Analytics to provide analytical analysis for user activity, and as such, tracking cookies may be used. All IP addresses collected through this method are anonymised, as outlined on the [Google docs](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052). Cookies can be disabled through the use of an adblocker with additional tracking disabled.

### Comment submission

When submitting a comment to a post, the user's name, email, comment body and IP address are stored in the database. Comments are forwarded to Akismet in the interest of detecting spam comments before being manually approved. For more information, refer to [Akismet's Privacy Policy](https://akismet.com/privacy/).

### New post subscriptions

When subscribing to future posts, the user's name and email are stored. Users are required to verify their email through clicking a confirmation link to prevent unwanted messages from being sent. An unsubscribe link is sent with every subsequent email in the event subscription is no longer wanted. All emails are sent in plaintext with no HTML or images.
