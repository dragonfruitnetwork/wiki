# Dragon6 API Migration Guides
These guides are aimed at developers using the Dragon6 API, and need a quick reference of breaking changes and how to resolve them.
Guides are written by contributors, and checked by primary maintainers. Where possible, guides will continue from one-another, reducing the complexity of large version jumps.

## Icons
Each change is marked with an icon to denote it's meaning/effort required to resolve. This list may expand as new icons are needed

|  Icon  | Description                        |
|--------|------------------------------------|
|  🗑️   | Removal                            |
|  ⚠️   | User written-code changes required |
|  🌱   | Replacement/Addition               |
