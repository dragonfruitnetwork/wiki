# Dragon6 Service Termination Notice

Dragon6 has been around since 2018 and during that time has evolved many times, including the addition of "modern stats", casual/unranked skill levels and more recently, Ranked 2.0 stats. At this point in time Ubisoft is making so many breaking changes it has become more time-consuming to repair the website and client, and with lower user counts compared to alternative services.

As a result of this, DragonFruit will discontinue the service as of **3rd April 2023**, after which the website and clients will no longer function. The API will be maintained for the forseeable future to allow others to embed stats into their own apps, with support being offered to developers using the library. We will also be making the token-rotating system we use internally public, and will archive dragon6-assets, dragon6 and dragon6-locale projects on GitHub.

Thank you to everyone that has used the service, especially those who have contributed to the development of the client.
