# Dragon6 Privacy Policy
#### Last Updated: January 2023

### **Overview**
Dragon6 is owned and operated by DragonFruit Network (also refered to as "We").  
The use of this service is subject to the agreement of the terms outlined in this page. Please also note that we may change these at any time, without notice.

### **Terms of Use**
You can find the Terms of Use [here](/wiki/dragon6/legal/terms)

### **What data do you collect?**
To operate Dragon6, we need to collect the player’s username and platform to be able to find their stats. This may mean that users lookup other players/accounts that aren’t theirs. These usernames are aliases and are publicly visible across different games/platforms.

When using the Dragon6 client, we also collect non-identifiable app version info (consisting of operating system and app version ids) to protect our service from unauthorized use.

### **What 3rd Party services do you use?**
We use Sentry to automatically report errors. This may involve sending non-identifiable device information (for example OS and browser version) to us to help diagnose issues.
In some older versions of Dragon6, we have also used Google Analytics to learn how people use our service. 

### **What about the Discord Bot?**
The Dragon6 Discord bot uses slash commands, and as such is only able to see the data directly provided to it. If you use the account name 'me', the bot will use your Discord account identifier to locate a linked account in our systems. No data provided to the Discord bot is retained after the interaction has completed.

### **What data do you store?**
Accounts being searched normally have no data stored except from the account information which is cached for approximately 12 hours. If you decide to signup to the site to access limited features, a Ubisoft profile will be required to link to a Social Media account (provided via Google). In this case we only use the Social Media login to consume the user ids. We store the Ubisoft id and Firebase id (social media login) along with any additional data provided by the user.  

Supporters (donors) get extra privileges, like the ability to upload custom backgrounds. DragonFruit Network accepts no responsibility for the content uploaded, but if you are an owner and would like a photo removed please email inbox@dragonfruit.network to discuss this.

Identifiers used for the purposes of logins are not shared, but some information is publicly available via our API. This data cannot be used to identify an account, nor identify its owner. An example of a public user profile can be seen below.

### **Do you sell data?**
No. We don’t sell data.

### **So, I signed up. Where is my data being stored?**
Sign-ins are currently managed by Google, with all other data securely stored on servers within the United Kingdom. All data is transferred using industry-standard encryption and is also encrypted at rest.

### **Can I request data collected from my is deleted?**
Yes, you can send an email to inbox@dragonfruit.network and we'll repsond with more details.

### **I don’t want people looking my account up. How do I stop this?**
No problem. All you need to do is email inbox@dragonfruit.network with a screenshot of the Dragon6 Stats page open and some proof of ownership (i.e. a Uplay window or a R6 Home Screen with the squad list open). We’ll then block your account and if you signed up, we’ll delete you from our database.

### **How accurate is the data you’re showing me?**
As accurate as it can be. On any of our sites/apps, the data is taken directly from Ubisoft servers, with no processing in-between. Your device processes this and displays the data directly. Very little of the data is cached, and when it is, it won't be for any longer than 10 minutes.

### **What about cookies?**
Cookies may be used for analytical purposes or storing signins. We suggest using an ad-blocker to prevent the use of non-essential cookies.

### **I have another question that you haven’t answered.**
Seriously? It’s not an issue. Email inbox@dragonfruit.network with your question and we’ll get back to you ASAP.
