Privacy Policy
==============

Overview
--------

DragonFruit Identity Platform (accessible at [https://id.dragonfruit.network](https://id.dragonfruit.network)) is designed to allow DragonFruit-developed services to integrate single-sign-on (SSO) login. It also allows for users to choose from a large range of 3rd party services to authenticate against.

> DragonFruit Network can be contacted by emailing [inbox@dragonfruit.network](mailto:inbox@dragonfruit.network)

Data Collected
--------------

When you (the 'user') first chooses an account to sign in with, you create an account. Once created, we store the following information:

*   Your Name
*   Your Email address
*   The unique identifier of any account you sign-in with
*   Any API clients you create to interact with our backend services
*   Any Application you consent to processing your data, with the option to revoke consent at any time

Our server logging system will also store diagnostic data like IP addresses and browser information, which is purged on a regular basis.

Authenticated applications recieve a unique account identifier generated by us, meaning any authenticated program can only access the email and name selected by you (after logging in), alongside this unique identifier. 3rd Party account information is only updated when you log in with the selected provider, we **do not** use offline access to update your information

Cookie Use
----------

We use a short-lived cookie to store your authentication session. This cookie expires when the browsing session ends. We do not use analytics services on the DragonFruit Identity Platform.

Third party services
--------------------

We use CloudFlare to provide us with a number of performance/security features and Sentry for automated error reporting. These services may collect additional data that is not outlined in this policy.

GDPR and CPPA requests can be sent to us, which grant the following rights:
